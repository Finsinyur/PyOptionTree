This project is started by a group of graduate students from Singapore Management University's Master in Quantitative Finance (MQF) programme. 
This project is an experiment and a practical application of learned knowledge from the programme, and a means to improve on our programming competencies.

The motivation behind creating an open-source python package for the Option Tree Pricing Model is that there is generally a gap in the Python open-source libraries, 
as compared to the more popular Monte Carlo approach and the Finite Element Difference method, to be filled. In addition, there are many interesting research papers 
exploring the use of a Tree model to price exotics. We aim to create packages based on those researches, to create a useful tool that could help bring those methods to 
practice.

Ultimately, we wish to create an open-source Python package that allows users to incorporate into their daily use - be it for academic studies, research, or practical
application in the industry. We hope to build a product that one could use to test new models developed in the industry, and to ascertain models introduced in new researches.
