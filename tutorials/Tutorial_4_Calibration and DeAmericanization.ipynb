    "Welcome to Tutorial 4 of the PyOptionTree tutorial series! \n",
    "\n",
    "We have come a long way since the first tutorial, when we started learning the basics of the ```pyop3``` functionalities, and understood the strengths and weaknesses of pricing European options using the tree methods. In the last tutorial, we took the step forward to work American option pricing using the ```pyop3```. This is a key value proposition of the Binomial Tree option pricing model - that it serves as a handy tool to price non-vanilla options which require explicitly solving each node along the path of the price evolution. Such options do not have a satisfactory closed-form solution; there are attempts to derive semi-analytical solutions that still require numerical approximation. There are some successes to derive a closed form solution for perpetual American put options, but having expiry at time infinite is no where close to realism. Hence, the binomial tree option pricing model still serves as a viable and simple approach to pricing American contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be delving into some possible practical use-cases of ```pyop3```, making use of functionalities we have introduced in earlier tutorials. As the title of the tutorial suggests, we will be focusing on:\n",

    "## Section 1: Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situation, one may wish to price a complex options. For simpler options that are listed and traded on exchanges, prices are relatively transparent as there are market makers putting bid and offer quotes on screen. However, for complex options, it is rather difficult to arrive at the fair value of the payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of a few things option writers would do is to derive the implied volatility from the market prices of a listed option on a related underlying asset - this could be of the same underlying, or one that exhibitis high correlation with the target underlying asset. With the implied volatility, one variable is obtained and it allows option writer to then value the payoff based on it. This process is known as calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calibration process is fairly straightforward; when using a Black-Scholes model, one simply needs to find an implied volatility that, when applied with the Black-Scholes option pricing formula, gives a theoretical price that matches the observed market price. As the market usually comes with a bid price and an ask price, we usually attempt to match the mid-price of the bid-ask. The optimal implied volatility can be easily found using root-finding algorithms, such as the Brent's method or the Newton's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the binomial tree option pricing model (specifically the CRR and RB trees) is a discrete version of the Black-Scholes model, the same calibration process could be applied. Recall from Tutorial 2 that the upward movement $u$ is related to the implied volatility of the option. In ```pyop3```, we attempt to fit the market price to the binomial tree option price, to arrive at the optimal $u$. As of ```pyop3``` v0.1.0, Brent's method is employed. \n",

Due to RB Tree's $u$ and $d$ parameters are more complex, we need to restrict the calibration range to between 1.0001 and 1.05. For CRR Tree, we could use the default range between 1.0001 to 10.0."
