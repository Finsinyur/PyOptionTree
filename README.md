# PyOptionTree

PyOptionTree is a package designed for implementing lattice models for option pricing.

The objective of this package is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-implement open-source tool for students, academics and practioners to run theoretical pricing of
various simple and exotic options. The early version of the library shall focus on developing the Binomial Tree algorithm for option pricing, taking into account of dividends and various types of options.

As a start, the Binomial tree algorithm implemented is based on the Cox-Ross-Rubenstein market model, published by Cox et al in their 1979 paper "Option Pricing: A Simplified Approach". For future extension, other alternatives will be incorporated, such as the Rendleman-Bartter (RB) tree and various improvements. In further future, the package will aim to include Trinomial tree models and use cases beyond option pricing.

Version: v0.0.1

## Getting Started

## A quick example

## Overview of Binomial tree option pricing models

## Features

### Underlying asset price dynamics

### Dividends treatment

### European options

### American options

### Visualizing the tree

### Calibration


### Underlying Asset Price Tree
In all tree models, the first step to solving for the option price is to evaluate the price dynamics of the underlying asset over time.
